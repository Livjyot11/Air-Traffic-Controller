## Description

This system will use monitors, radars, radios and other special instruments to provide proper guidance to the flying aircrafts. In other words, it would provide ground controllers complete details of the flight that would help them in directing an aircraft while remaining on the ground, and can even provide advisory services to the non- controlled airspace.

The main purpose and goal of the designed system is to make air travel completely safe by avoiding the risk of aircraft collisions with the increasing number of aircrafts that can fly safely at the same time. This system uses an aircraft navigation and communication system in constantly locating the plane with its speed and altitude for every individual aircraft that is flying. It would play an important role in managing air traffic with their monitors, and help instructing the pilots to maintain a safe operation of the aircrafts.

## Features of the System
The system computers will show a list of readouts and controls that would be digitally viewed by ATC instructors to guide an aircraft’s pilot. These include:
Readouts for the aircraft that will show all the visual record or display all the information of the plane either by searching it or by filtering planes by entering the flight number in the filter menu. These show the flight name by its number, image, scheduled takeoff and landing time, and will be able to see all other necessary details. We would also able to see its:

* **Location:** A complete world map is shown on their monitors to locate or navigate a specific aircraft at any time we want.
* **Route:** The entire route of an aircraft is assigned before its travel, and ATC has full records from where it would depart from, and where it would be landing with its exact timings and a pre-assigned path which will be unique for every flight with respect to its altitude, speed and time of travel.
* **Weather Reports:** They can detect the weather conditions for the entire route in which the plane would be travelling in future, so that it could not create any kind of problem and can easily warn the pilots and suggest delays or the change of flight route.
* **Others:** It will show the speed and altitude of the aircraft and many other necessary information if needed in more option.

Controls will help to change the map view to day, night, terrain, satellite or hybrid view. It will also allow us to search a specific flight by its number to know all its details by using filters options in the bottom menu. Also, we will be able to change the time zone, clock time, speed, altitude and distance units in the settings option in the main menu.

## License
Distributed under the MIT License. 

I have chosen this license because it is simple, permissive and optimized for developers. Its free of charge without limiting the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute and sublicense and/or sell copies of the Software. A significant benefit of using the MIT license is that it serves both sides of the debate equally well. Due to the MIT License’s open language, it’s suitable for both community developers and teams that want to produce propriety software using existing pieces of MIT licensed code.

## Conclusion

To conclude, the system has been designed by deeply studying and understanding the basic principles of ergonomics which will increase the quality, efficiency and productivity of the system as a whole. This simple schematic design is based on the virtual reality that is similar to the system in real world. But makes it a completely different for the ground controllers as it proves to provide a more safe and comfortable experience to its employees. Overall, the system’s hardware and software is designed in such a way that it would deal with every aspect of ergonomics and will be able to solve all the problems in the existing work environment.
